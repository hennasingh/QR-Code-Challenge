## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I have worked on more complex projects before and going back to this simple one felt more tricky than ever. To begin, I struggled with centering the QR code in the middle. I had forgotten that I needed to provide `height` property for doing it.

```css
main {
    display:flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height:100vh;
}
```
